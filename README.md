# Soft Arm Control via Deep Reinforcement Learning
The soft arm robot can learn to track a target within its reachable space.[[video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWhmce04CdI&list=PLQFQ6M344AWfH7qtK-xf0zY1FP0QjG_QW)


### 1. example_nets
Some usage examples of neural networks that might be used
- [batch normalization network](https://github.com/ZhiangChen/soft_arm/blob/master/example_nets/batch_normalization_example.ipynb)

### 2. labview
Low-level controller on Labview

### 3. launch
`bash
roslaunch soft_arm soft_arm.launch
`
will launch naive_pose_pub.py, target_pub.py, and read_state for test purpose.
